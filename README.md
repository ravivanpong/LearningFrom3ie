# LearningFrom3ie
This project explores a basic application of natural language processing (NLP) in evidence synthesis, using the impact evaluation report curated by the 3ie.

## Data
The data are crawled from the 3ie Development Evidence Portal (https://developmentevidence.3ieimpact.org/) and Evidence impact summaries (https://www.3ieimpact.org/evidence-hub/evidence-impact-summaries).

## Tasks

### Text classification

### Hierarchical topic modeling

### Summarization

### Causality extraction

## Disclaimer
This is just a demonstration. The pipeline and hyperparameters are not yet optimized. This means, there are still rooms for improvement.
